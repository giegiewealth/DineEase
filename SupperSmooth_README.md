## About SupperSmooth:

SupperSmooth was born out of a desire to simplify the dining experience for both customers and restaurant owners. As avid food enthusiasts, we often found ourselves frustrated with traditional paper menus and the cumbersome ordering process, especially during peak dining hours. Inspired to create a solution that seamlessly integrates technology into the dining experience, we embarked on the journey to develop SupperSmooth.

Our inspiration came from observing the inefficiencies and frustrations faced by both customers and restaurant staff during our dining experiences. We envisioned a solution that would leverage modern technology to streamline the menu browsing and ordering process, while also providing restaurant owners with real-time insights and control over their menus.

Technical Challenge:

One of the main technical challenges we encountered was integrating QR code scanning and NFC technology across both mobile and web platforms. We had to carefully design and implement the frontend and backend components to ensure a seamless user experience regardless of the device used. Additionally, refining the real-time menu update feature posed challenges in managing data synchronization and ensuring data consistency across multiple users and devices.

Solution:

To address these challenges, we utilized Flutter for cross-platform development, Firebase for backend services, and integrated QR code scanning and NFC technology using third-party libraries. We implemented a real-time database for menu management, allowing restaurant owners to update their menus instantly and customers to view the latest offerings in real-time.
